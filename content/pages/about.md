title: About me
---
Hey there! My name is Tomek Buszewski and I’ve been „doing web” professionally for the past 12 years. 

## Beginnings

Actually, I’ve started way earlier. In 2000 or 2001, I’ve found an article in _CD-Action_ about HTML, with some examples in it! And that is how I’ve made my first web page. It’s not around anymore, obviously, but it was horrible, with red background, black, blue and white text. I was really drawn to it, as I thought that „this is programming”. Next year I was honored at my elementary school’s computer science classes with an A on my diploma – for doing such websites.

Fast-forward couple of years, I am in high school, doing PHP, MySQL and front-end of all sorts. It was the wildest time of my life, staying late just to code some more, creating CMS’, learning Kohana (this thing still around?), being frightened by Zend and amazed by jQuery. I remember struggling to get up at 5:30 to go to school (yes, getting up early was there from the beginning, how I loathe it) after staying up way after midnight. I don’t have to say I didn’t pass with flying colors. Rather I had to spread myself thin just to pass. 

## First-time earnings

I am 19 now, just graduated and have to earn money for a living. Fun fact, I tried to get a job as a carpenter in the town’s employment office, because the pay was good, but failed. 

Back then, I already had some portfolio of websites I’ve done. Some for fun, some for contests, some for friends. Some were even rebranded and sold! So, I thought, why not! Unfortunately, I don’t have any screenshots from back then. But it was really „in the vein” of the times, a single page with screenshots and brief description. It actually netted me a few customers. I was able to make a living doing websites!

This went on for a couple of years. I’ve been redoing my portfolio, getting more and more work, but always struggled to get well financially. Sometimes clients refused to pay. I was rather cheap, so they knew I won’t sue. And exploited it. Sometimes, clients decided that they don’t want a website anymore. Sometimes I was just tired of changing something for the nth time. Plus, I was working with agencies a lot. And they could pay me after the client paid them. 

A lot of work has escaped me, as I was unable to meet with clients face to face. I was living in my hometown – Sanok – which is really stunning visually, but is located in the south-eastern part of Poland. Getting to Warsaw by bus takes eight hours. I couldn’t afford going there couple of times per month, both time- and financial-wise.

Being close to graduation (yes, I was studying as well), I was often visiting the careers office at the college. A note has grabbed my attention. A local agency was looking for a „webmaster”. I sent my CV the minute I got home and got invited to an interview the next day! (Yes, Sanok was small, so all was going very fast. Now I am lucky if I get an invitation in the same week.) After a short talk I was hired! 

By by-then standards, I was earning a lot. I could finally afford games and books! I was able to pay the bills without worrying that it may not be enough! Great times. Plus, I was still pulling my freelance work (in a smaller extent though). This was the high life I was aiming for all this time. But after a few months, things were starting to go awry. I did all the work that was behind the schedule in the first month, as those were simple WordPress-based pages. Then I was mostly doing graphic design – posters, banners, stickers. And then… nothing. People didn’t really need websites in Sanok in 2012. We all knew this won’t last, and it didn’t. I left the place the following year and got back to just freelancing.

## Big town!

In 2014 year, thanks to [Mariusz Herma](https://www.ziemianiczyja.pl/) (basically, it wouldn’t be possible without him, so thanks again!), I managed to live in Warsaw, after landing a job in [radiozet.pl](https://radiozet.pl). Looking back, I think it was one of the best places I’ve been, with great people all around.

In 2016, I’ve been hired in [Gremi Media](https://gremimedia.pl/) to supervise new front-end for [rp.pl](https://www.rp.pl/) and eventually [parkiet.com](https://www.parkiet.com/). After a few months, I was appointed team leader of the latter project, and we’ve decided that we’ll be making the new Parkiet in-house. All the frontend was done by [Ievgenii](https://github.com/ievgen11), Artur and me. We were really pulling all the stops and after all, did it. I was responsible for the stack and architecture, but in the end, we all did everything we could and no one cared whether he was the man for the job. If it required doing, someone did it.

In 2018, I was in 4finance, responsible for [vivus.pl](https://vivus.pl) at the beginning. After a month, I was promoted to a Core Web Team member and I was working on really high-level stuff. We were building frameworks for other teams to use, so, for example, on Monday I was working on our framework with the Core Team, and on Tuesday I was using it on vivus’ page. Few months have passed and our area manager has left. So I got this job! I was thrilled, as I always liked being a manager. I had two teams to care about – in Poland and in Lithuania. Those were great people, I really loved how we got along and how we were doing as a team of devs. 

In 2019, I was approached by [Batmaid](https://batmaid.ch/en/) to help them get their front-end together. After a few days I’ve decided that refactoring is a must and created some PoC that got accepted by the higher-ups. I was a lead front-end developer in there and was responsible for everything related to this matter. From picking the entire stack and architecture, to creating the UI, to designing test and deployment pipelines. I am pretty proud of it, especially since it has proven to be very adaptable by the other developer we’ve hired in the summer. 

Now, it’s 2020 and I am starting my new job at [TVN](https://www.tvn.pl/). I am here to build a new team based in Warsaw that’ll be working closely with the journalists. I am thrilled to see what’ll come out of it!
